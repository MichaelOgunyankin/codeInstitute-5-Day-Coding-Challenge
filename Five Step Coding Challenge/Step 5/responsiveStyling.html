<!-- Welcome to your Lesson 5 - Challenge 1
Our recipe site is really coming together now. We next need to make sure that its design and structural integrity is maintained across device sizes. Your challenge is to make your recipe page be responsive to the size of the screen that it is viewed on.
 
In particular, you will:
Add an outer container that wraps around all the content of the page
Target that container with a style that sets the container width and also centers the container
Target that container with a media query that contains styles that are triggered once the screen size goes below a certain value -->

				<ol>
					<li>
	                Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!
					</li>
					<li>
						Pop a tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)
					</li>
					<li>
						Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
					</li>
					<li>
						Enjoy!
					</li>
