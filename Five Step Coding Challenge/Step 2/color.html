<!--
In particular, you will:
style a <h1> element
style a <p> element
style an <em> element
style a <strong> element
You'll do this by using element selectors (style rules that have the same selector names as the HTML elements they are targeting).
In this challenge, each style rule will contain one style declaration that will target its associated HTML element.
